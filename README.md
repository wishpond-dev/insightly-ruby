# Insightly

Ruby Library for the Insightly REST API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'insightly'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install insightly

The gem requires Ruby 2.0.0 and above.

## Sample Code

Set client the API key.
```
client = Insightly.new(api_key)
```

Get contacts.
```
contacts = client.get_contacts
```

Get a contact.
```
contact = client.get_contact(id: 1)
```

Create a contact.

```
# Build JSON serialized attributes.
# The gem won't do this for you. You need to build a serializer that meets your needs."
contact_attributes = {
  "first_name"=>"Tyler",
  "last_name"=>"Durden",
  "image_url"=>"https://fakedomain.imgix.net/user_photos/man.jpg?crop=faces&fit=crop&h=96&w=96",
  "contactinfos"=>[{"contact_id"=>0, "type"=>"Email", "subtype"=>"", "label"=>"Work", "detail"=>"tylerdurden@ucsv.edu"}],
  "links"=>[],
  "tags"=>[],
  "date_created_utc"=>"2014-10-11 23:20:04",
  "date_updated_utc"=>"2014-10-23 17:27:25",
  "contact_id"=>81126408
}

# Create the contact.
contact = client.create_contact(contact: contact_attributes)
```

Update a contact.
```
# Build JSON serialized attributes.
# The gem won't do this for you. You need to build a serializer that meets your needs."
# contact_attributes = <same as create>

# Update the contact.
contact = client.update_contact(contact: contact_attributes)
```

Delete a contact.
```
client.delete_contact(id: 1)
```

## Error handling

The client will raise an ```Insightly::Errors::ClientError``` if the action failed or
an ```Insightly::Errors::ResourceNotFoundError``` if the target resource cannot be found in the API.

Depending on your implementation you may want to rescue these errors as follows:

```
begin
  client.delete_contact(id: 1)
rescue Insightly::Errors::ResourceNotFoundError => e
  Rails.logger.error "Insightly contact not found: #{e.inspect}"
rescue Insightly::Errors::ClientError => e
  Rails.logger.error "Insightly contact delete failed: #{e.inspect}"
end
```
If you don't care whether or not the resource is found you can simply do the following:

```
begin
  client.delete_contact(id: 1)
rescue Insightly::Errors::ClientError => e
  Rails.logger.error "Insightly contact delete failed: #{e.inspect}"
end
```
This will also catch ```Insightly::Errors::ResourceNotFoundError``` but is less specific.
